# MODX Public Registry

This repository serves as the official public registry and disclosure record for the MODX sovereign financial, governance, and security platform.

MODX is designed to operate non-custodial financial rails, synthetic exchange-traded instruments, decentralized governance mechanisms, and privacy-preserving identity enforcement systems across institutional, corporate, and retail domains.

- Provide timestamped public disclosure of pre-launch infrastructure  
- Publish on-chain smart contract addresses and verification status  
- Distinguish pre-launch components from post-launch activations  
- Support regulatory, investor, and audit transparency  

This repository **does not contain platform source code** and is not used in runtime operations.

Experience modules and consumer-facing systems activate post-launch.
